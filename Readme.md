## ‚ú® Core Features

### Expense Management
* **Dynamic Dashboard**: Instantly add expenses with a description, amount, and category.
* **Real-time Updates**: The total balance and expense list update automatically without page reloads.
* **Complete History**: View a chronological list of all past expenses.
* **Effortless Deletion**: Remove single expenses with a click.
* **Total Reset**: A secure, confirmation-based option to wipe the slate clean.

### Authentication & Security
* **User Registration & Login**: Secure account creation and login system.
* **Secure JWT Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens stored in `httpOnly` cookies for secure, stateless sessions.
* **Password Hashing**: User passwords are encrypted using `bcryptjs` and are never stored in plain text.
* **Protected Routes**: All user data and expense pages are protected, accessible only after logging in.
* **Personalized Data**: Each user can only view and manage their own expenses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern, full-stack architecture:

* **Frontend & Views**:
    * `HTML5`
    * `EJS (Embedded JavaScript)` for server-side rendering of dynamic pages.
    * `Tailwind CSS` for utility-first styling.
    * `JavaScript (ES6+)` for client-side interactivity and API communication.
* **Backend**:
    * `Node.js` as the JavaScript runtime environment.
    * `Express.js` for building the robust API and serving pages.
    * `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying JWTs.
    * `cookie-parser` for handling `httpOnly` cookies.
    * `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing.
* **Database**:
    * `MongoDB` as the NoSQL database.
    * `Mongoose` for elegant data modeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a classic server-side rendering pattern with a RESTful API for data.

1.  **View (Server)**: When a user requests a page like `/login` or `/tracker`, the Express server uses EJS to render the appropriate `.ejs` file from the `views` folder, sending a complete HTML page to the browser.
2.  **Authentication Middleware**: Protected routes are guarded by middleware that checks for a valid JWT in the user's cookies. If the token is valid, the user can proceed; otherwise, they are redirected to the login page.
3.  **Client-Side Script**: Once a page is loaded, client-side JavaScript takes over for interactivity. It captures events (like form submissions) and sends requests to the backend API endpoints using `fetch`.
4.  **API Routes & Controllers**: The Express API receives these requests, and a controller function processes the business logic, interacting with the database model.
5.  **Model**: The Mongoose model communicates with the MongoDB database to create, read, update, or delete records associated with the logged-in user.
6.  **Response**: The API sends data back to the client as JSON, and the client-side JavaScript updates the webpage dynamically.
